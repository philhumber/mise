## Ingredients

### Roux

- 25g unsalted butter
- 25g plain flour

### Sauce

- 300ml turkey stock (or beef/veal stock)
- 100–150ml double cream (or crème fraîche)
- 1 tsp soy sauce
- Pinch of ground allspice
- White pepper, to taste
- Fine sea salt, to taste

### Optional Finishes

- 1–2 tbsp lingonberry jam
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard (omit if using lingonberry)
- Splash of Worcestershire sauce
- 15g cold unsalted butter, for mounting

## Method

1. **Make the Roux.** Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add all the flour at once and whisk immediately to coat every particle in fat, forming a smooth paste. Cook 2–3 minutes until the roux reaches a blond stage—it should smell nutty and lose any raw flour aroma. Do not allow it to colour significantly.

2. **Incorporate Stock.** Add a small splash of stock to the roux, whisking vigorously until fully absorbed. Continue adding stock gradually, whisking constantly between additions, until all stock is incorporated and the sauce is smooth.

3. **Simmer.** Bring to a gentle simmer and cook 10–15 minutes, stirring occasionally, to fully hydrate the starch and cook out any floury taste.

4. **Add Cream and Seasonings.** Reduce heat to low. Stir in cream, soy sauce, and allspice. Season with white pepper and salt to taste.

5. **Finish.** If using lingonberry jam, whisk in 1 tablespoon, taste, and add more if desired. Alternatively, whisk in Dijon and/or Worcestershire sauce. For extra gloss, remove from heat and mount with cold butter, swirling until emulsified.

## Notes

**Deglazing.** If browning meatballs beforehand, deglaze that pan with a splash of stock and add the fond scrapings to the sauce for deeper flavour.

**Consistency.** The 25g:25g:300ml ratio yields a coating consistency. For thinner sauce, reduce roux to 20g each; for thicker, increase to 30g each.

**Crème fraîche.** Substituting for double cream adds a pleasant tang that complements the richness of the meatballs.

**The temperature rule.** Hot stock into hot roux works perfectly well—the key is gradual addition and constant whisking, not temperature differential.

**Yield.** Approximately 400ml finished sauce.

**Lingonberry variation.** Adding jam directly to the sauce gives a subtle fruity tartness that cuts through the cream. Start with 1 tablespoon and adjust to taste. Skip the Dijon if going this route—the flavours compete—but Worcestershire still works well.
