## Ingredients

### Hydration Mix

- 500ml cold water
- 1/4 tsp fine sea salt
- 2 tbsp fresh lemon or lime juice
- 1-2 tbsp honey or maple syrup (to taste)
- Pinch of cream of tartar (optional, for potassium)

## Method

1. **Combine.** Add salt, citrus juice, and sweetener to water. Stir until salt and sweetener dissolve completely.

2. **Adjust.** Taste and adjust sweetness. It should be refreshing, not overly sweet - you'll be drinking this all shift.

3. **Chill.** Keep refrigerated. Best consumed within 24 hours.

## Notes

This is the kitchen equivalent of a sports drink - replaces sodium lost through sweating during long service. The citrus provides vitamin C and makes it palatable. Adjust salt up if you're sweating heavily. Double or triple the recipe and keep a jug in the walk-in.
