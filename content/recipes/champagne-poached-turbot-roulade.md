## Ingredients

### Turbot Roulade

- 450–550g fresh turbot fillet, skinned, boned, trimmed to uniform rectangles
- 6g fine sea salt (approximately 1.2%)
- Activa RM (transglutaminase) for dusting
- 30ml Champagne poaching liquor
- 15g cold butter, cubed

### Champagne Dashi

- 5g kombu (dried kelp)
- 150ml very cold water
- 5g katsuobushi (bonito flakes)

### Champagne Poaching Liquor

- 150ml Champagne dashi
- 300ml Champagne or dry sparkling wine
- 1 shallot, sliced
- 1 celery stalk, diced
- 1 strip lemon zest
- 3 white peppercorns
- 1 bay leaf

### Celeriac Velouté

- 300g celeriac, peeled and diced
- 1 shallot, minced
- 20g butter
- 250ml light chicken stock (or vegetable stock for lighter colour)
- 100ml double cream
- Fine sea salt
- Lemon juice

### Garnish

- 1 Granny Smith apple
- 100ml water, 50ml lemon juice, 5g sugar (acidulation liquid)
- 20g black lumpfish roe (or caviar)
- Micro-celery or chervil (optional)

## Method

### T-48h

1. **Make Champagne Dashi.** Soak kombu in cold water for 30 minutes. Bring gently to 65°C—do not boil or it becomes slimy and bitter. Remove kombu. Raise heat to 85°C, turn off heat, add bonito flakes. Steep for 30 seconds only—pure umami, no smoke. Strain immediately through fine cloth. Chill.

2. **Make Champagne Poaching Liquor.** Combine Champagne dashi with Champagne, shallot, celery, lemon zest, peppercorns, and bay leaf in a pot. Bring to a simmer for 10 minutes. Turn off heat, cover, and cool completely. Strain and refrigerate.

3. **Prepare Velouté Base.** Sweat shallots and celeriac in butter without colour. Add stock and simmer until celeriac is mash-tender. Blitz in a blender until smooth. Do not add cream yet. Refrigerate. Ageing 48 hours improves flavour through starch retrogradation.

### T-24h

4. **Prepare the Fish.** Lay turbot fillets on a board. Ensure even thickness throughout. Season evenly with salt.

5. **Apply Transglutaminase.** Using a fine tea strainer, dust the surface of the fish with Activa RM. You want a fine snow, not clumps.

6. **Roll the Roulade.** Roll the fish tightly into a cylinder using cling film. Prick any air bubbles with a needle. Twist the ends of the cling film tightly like a candy wrapper and tie them off.

7. **Set Overnight.** Refrigerate for 12–24 hours to allow the transglutaminase to bond.

### Day-of

8. **Cook the Fish.** Place the wrapped roulade inside a vacuum bag. Add 30ml Champagne poaching liquor and the cold butter. Seal gently—don't crush the cylinder. Cook at 48°C for 30 minutes. Remove and immediately plunge into an ice bath for 20 minutes. Refrigerate until 1 hour before service.

9. **Finish the Velouté.** Warm the celeriac base. Whisk in the cream. Pass through a fine sieve or chinois—this is non-negotiable for refined texture. Season with salt and a drop of lemon juice.

10. **Prepare Apple Brunoise.** Mix the acidulation liquid. Peel apple and cut into precise 2mm × 2mm brunoise. Store submerged in the liquid.

### T-1h

11. **Slice the Fish.** Remove roulade from bag and unwrap. Slice into 4 even medallions while cold—it slices cleanly when chilled.

12. **Temper the Fish.** Place slices on a small tray, cover loosely with cling film, and leave at room temperature. The fish is served at room temperature (approximately 21°C). The heat comes from the soup. Do not reheat the fish or you risk overcooking.

13. **Final Garnish Prep.** Drain the apples on paper towels—they must be completely dry or liquid will pool under the roe. Keep roe on ice.

### Service

14. **Plate.** Ladle approximately 50ml hot velouté into the centre of a warm shallow bowl. Tap the bowl to flatten the liquid. Place the turbot medallion gently in the centre of the soup—the heat from the velouté warms the fish from below. Carefully spoon 1 tsp apple brunoise directly onto the centre of the fish. Top the apple with a small quenelle or mound of roe. Serve immediately.

## Notes

- The reduced bonito (5g vs standard 10–15g) keeps umami subtle, allowing Champagne minerality to come through.
- 48°C sous vide yields a translucent, custardy texture. For firmer fish, increase to 50–52°C.
- Drain apple brunoise thoroughly before plating to prevent pooling under the roe.
- Ageing the celeriac purée 48 hours improves mouthfeel through starch retrogradation.
