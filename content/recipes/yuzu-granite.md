## Timeline

- **Day-of** Prepare granité base and freeze
- **Service** Scrape granité, whip matcha cream, plate

## Ingredients

### Granité Base

- 300ml water
- 80g caster sugar
- 2 green tea bags or 2 tsp loose leaf sencha
- 60ml fresh yuzu juice (or 40ml yuzu juice + 20ml lemon juice)
- Zest of 1 yuzu (or 1 lemon)

### Matcha Cream

- 150ml double cream
- 1 tsp matcha powder, sifted
- 1 tbsp icing sugar

### Finishing

- 2 tbsp finely diced candied ginger
- Fresh mint leaves (optional)

## Method

### Day-of

1. **Make Tea Syrup.** Bring water and sugar to a simmer, stirring until dissolved. Remove from heat. Add tea bags or loose tea. Steep for 5 minutes - no longer or it becomes bitter. Strain and cool to room temperature.

2. **Mix Granité Base.** Combine tea syrup with yuzu juice and zest. Pour into a shallow metal pan or baking dish. The shallower the pan, the faster it freezes.

3. **Freeze.** Place in freezer. After 1 hour, scrape with a fork to break up ice crystals. Repeat every 30-45 minutes until fully frozen and flaky - about 3-4 hours total.

### Service

4. **Prepare Matcha Cream.** Whisk cream, sifted matcha, and icing sugar until soft peaks form. Do not over-whip - should be billowy, not stiff.

5. **Scrape Granité.** Run fork through frozen granité to create light, fluffy ice crystals.

6. **Plate.** Spoon matcha cream into chilled bowls or glasses. Top with a generous mound of granité. Scatter candied ginger over the top. Garnish with mint if using. Serve immediately.

## Notes

The granité can be made up to 3 days ahead - just scrape again before serving. If it freezes solid, let it sit at room temperature for 5 minutes before scraping.
